<img align="center" src="Data_Pipeline_2.jpg">


The second step in the data pipeline involved extracting and cleaning the data from the three different sources and then loading the data into two pandas dataframes:

1. <b>Reviews DataFrame:</b> <br>211,452 reviews

2. <b>Wines DataFrame:</b> <br>78.044 wines

<br>
Exploratory data analysis and visualization was conducted on the two dataframes to understand key characteristics of the data and for purposes of identifying outliers, incorrect data and missing data.
