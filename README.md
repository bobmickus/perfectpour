A Python-based wine recommender system that web scrapes user ratings on wines and combines it with wine attributes to determine latent features. Numerous matrix factorization models were created and evaluated using the GraphLab Create machine learning framework.

Phase Two of the project will involve enhancing the recommender through the use of the Watson Alchemy Sentiment Analysis API to extract text comments from the user wine reviews and perform sentiment analysis.
